Male, 24. Interested in computer science, guitar, sports and American dramas, love animals.
When I was a child, I read a lot, from <<100k whys>>, to <<The encyclopedia for children>>, from <<The king of fairy tale>>, to <<Reader>>. I was in a mood pleasure to show off knowledges I acquired from books, my classmates were kind of admiring me, that was cool, I like that feeling.

Another big hobby of me was play, all kind of play, I had tons of toys, I like mechanic toys, there’s a kind of racing car model named “si qu che” very popular at that time, I bought a lot of them. I also take apart many electronic things. My parents was in an attitude of supporting ’cause they think those hobbies were good for IQ. 
When I began to access computers, it was in my father’s office, I use them to play card games, watch cartoons. I was in primary school at that time, I wish I could learning programming from then but there’s even no network at that time, actually, I started programming from college..
I treat computer as an game station until senior high school, that was when I start to read some magazines about computers. <<popular softwares>> and <<computer for middle school students>>, these magazines gain me some basic concepts of computers, and also introduce me many funny softwares.
To Be Continued..
