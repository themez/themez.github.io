I start this blog mostly motivated by some posts by the famous IT blog [Coding Horror](http://codinghorror.com). I always think myself a smart guy, but I'm not good at communication. Jeff Atwood says a great programmer must be good at communication. I deeply agree with that, there're many great programmer, they can promote their craft to the world, everyone can make their project open source, but very few of them can make their project widely used by others. I'm not even a good programmer yet, I'm still learning a lot of things, and I need practice my communication skill, my presentation skill. From this day, I will try to write out some of my thoughts.
